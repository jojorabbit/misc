math.sqrt(15)               # can use functions of math module
from math import sqrt       # can import functions so we don't need to type math. infront of the function
from math import *          # can import every thing, this is bad idea as function can conflict with each others

// Build in function

max(10,15,-15)              # return max value

abs(-64)                    # return absolute value
type(42)                    # return type of value, in this case it would be int (not a string)
