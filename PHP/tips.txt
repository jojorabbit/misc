Switch Case faster than If-ElseIf

echo is slightly faster than print

pre-increment 10% faster than post-increment 

echo $i++;  /* the printed value would be
                   $i before the increment
                   (post-increment) */
				   
echo ++$i;	/* the printed value would be
                   $i after the increment
                   (pre-increment) */			   
				   
				   
for ($i = 1; $i <= 10; ++$i) {  // doesn't matter pre- or post-increment 
    echo $i;
}				   


$row['id'] is 7 times faster than $row[id]
